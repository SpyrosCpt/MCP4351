# MCP4351
Arduino Library for MCP4351 Digital Potentiometer

About
This library can be used for interfacing and controlling the MCP4351 IC with the Arduino. The MCP4351 IC is a volatile, 8-bit (257 wiper steps) digital potentiometers with an SPI compatible interface. It is available with end-to-end resistor values of 5K立, 10K立, 50k立 and 100K立. More information on the product page.Other MCP42xx family ICs can also be used, but full functionality of the library may not be guaranteed.

Features
All available controls as per MCP4351 datasheet.
Additional functions like DigitalPotResistanceToPosition and DigitalPotPositionToResistance.
Simple to use.
Multiple MCP4351v ICs can be interfaced and controlled, subjected to the availability of I/O pins on Arduino board.

Usage
Two examples are available in library. Following is the simple example of interfacing a single MCP4351 with the Arduino. Only one potentiometer (pot0) is controlled and wiper is set to a position = 256.

#include <MCP4351.h>

#define chipSelectPin 53
#define pot0ResistanceRmax 98600 // These resistance values may vary
#define pot0ResistanceRmin 113.5
#define pot1ResistanceRmax 98600
#define pot2ResistanceRmin 130

MCP4351 digitalPot(chipSelectPin, pot0ResistanceRmax, pot0ResistanceRmin, pot1ResistanceRmax, pot2ResistanceRmin);

bool potNum = 1;
uint16_t pos;

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
    digitalPot.begin();
}

void loop()
{
    pos = 256;
    digitalPot.DigitalPotSetWiperPosition(potNum, pos);

    while(1)
    {
    }
}
